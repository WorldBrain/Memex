# Memex Features

A browser extension to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents.
Its name and functionalities are heavily inspired by [Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex](http://memex.link/S1zVMgKzX/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

## Full-Text Search in Bookmarks:

Search with every word of all websites & PDFs you bookmarked, tagged, listed, or annotated. Filter by time, domain, list, or tags.

## No VC Money, No Exit: Your Data & Attention Stays Yours

Memex is funded without VC money or selling shares. Instead we are funded with a model called "Steward Ownership". This model ensures that the company can never be sold and our investors are rewarded with a capped profit share. This way we will never be tempted by incentivizes to optimise our company for maximising growth and shareholder profits at the expense of your privacy, attention, or freed to choose a provider.
You can find more about our choice [in this post](https://community.worldbrain.io/t/why-worldbrain-io-does-not-take-venture-capital/75).

## Other:

‚õÖ Backup and restore your data to any of your favorite cloud providers including Google Drive

üì≤ Import bookmarks and history from other services

‚å® Keyboard Shortcuts for everything

üóÇ Tab manager: add all open tabs to a collection or tag
