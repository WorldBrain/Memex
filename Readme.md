# WorldBrain's WebMemex

A browser extension that lets you create, search and share your personal web of knowledge.

 - **Full-Text Search** pages and you visited and bookmarked (and later) also all the apps you use to organise your knowledge.
 - **Manually and automatically create links** between your content to organise & search your web by *your associations*
 - **Share** content recommendations, associations and qualifying metadata with your network and followers


## Project status

Sorry to disappoint, but we do not have the promised solution complete yet. :unamused:

In its current released version, the you can full-text search the browsing history & bookmarks.
Here you can download it: [worldbrain.io/download](http://worldbrain.io/download)

At the moment we are in the process of refactoring/porting the features of the [WorldBrain (Re)search-Engine](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Research-Engine/) into the *WebMemex*, a project started by [@treora](https://github.com/Treora)

This project is in full development. You are most welcome to contribute! See
[Hacking](#hacking) below about how to build and run it from source and teach it
new tricks.


## Approach

As it stands now, it is a WebExtension (thus should work on most modern
browsers), bundled by [browserify](http://browserify.org) with some
[babel](https://babeljs.io) ES6–7→ES5 compilation, that logs and stores visited
pages in [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com), and provides a viewer for this data
based on
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)+[Redux](http://redux.js.org/). See
[Code Anatomy](#code-anatomy) below for a full tour du code.

The project strategy is to combine and integrate features from other projects,
and to factor out developed functionality into separate modules wherever it
seems sensible. This extension could then be regarded as a bunch of different
(but related) features a browser ought to have, bundled together for quick
installation.

See [our initial blog post](https://blog.webmemex.org/2017/01/05/roadmap/)
for the feature roadmap of the next few months.

## Hacking

Like playing with ES6, WebExtension browser APIs, React, Redux, PouchDB? Come
play along! :tada:

### Build and run it

1. Clone this repo.
2. Get [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org).
3. Run `make`.
4. Load it in Firefox or Chromium/Chrome:
    * In Firefox (≥49): run `make fx-run` (or run [web-ext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/web-ext_command_reference#web-ext_run)
      directly for more control).
      Alternatively, go to [`about:debugging`](about:debugging), choose 'Load
      Temporary Add-on', and pick `extension/manifest.json` from this repo.
    * In Chromium/Chrome: go to [Tools→Extensions](chrome://extensions/), enable
      'Developer mode', 'Load unpacked extension...', pick the `extension/`
      folder from this repo.
    * Others browsers: let know if you have tested it!

*If NPM (during `make`) fails to install dependencies because a nasty firewall blocks the `git://` protocol, check [this solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4891527/git-protocol-blocked-by-company-how-can-i-get-around-that/10729634#10729634)*

### Automatic recompilation

If the steps above worked, running `make watch` will trigger a quick
recompilation every time a source file has been modified.

If you are testing in Firefox through `make fx-run`/`web-ext`, the extension
should also reload automatically. Otherwise, depending on which part of the code
you change, you may have to reload the extension in your browser:

- If your edits affected only the overview interface, just refresh/reopen it.
- However, if you changed the background script, you have will to reload the
  extension: find it back in the list of temporary add-ons/extensions and click
  Reload.
- If you changed the 'content_script', it seems browser-dependent whether newly
  opened pages will get the new version. Better reload the extension to be sure.


## Code Anatomy

### WebExtension parts

To comply with the [anatomy of a WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension),
it consists of three main parts (found in [`extension/`](extension/) after
compilation):

- `background.js` always runs, in an 'empty invisible tab', listening for
  messages and events.
- `content_script.js` is loaded into every web page that is visited. It is
  invisible from that web page's own scripts, and can talk to the background
  script.
- `overview/overview.html`, with the resources in that folder, provides the main
  user interface.

The parts communicate in two ways:
- Messaging through `browser.sendMessage`, usually done implicitly by using a
  remote procedure call ([`util/webextensionRPC.js`](src/util/webextensionRPC.js)).
- Through the in-browser PouchDB database, they get to see the same data, and
  can react to changes made by other parts.

Besides these parts,
[`browser-polyfill.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill/)
provides the promise-based `browser` API, that simply wraps Chromium/Chrome's
callback-based `chrome` API, in order to make the same code run in different
browsers (and to structure the callback mess).

### Source organisation

To keep things modular, the source code in [`src/`](src/) is not split in
exactly those the three parts of the extension, but is rather grouped by
functionality. Some folders may end up being factored out into separate repos
later on, or at some point perhaps even into separate but interacting browser
extensions.

#### [`src/activity-logger/`](src/activity-logger/): activity logger

This logs every page visit in PouchDB. Soon it should also watch for user
interactions, for example to remember which parts of a page you have read.

Currently, for every visit, a new page object is created in the database, to
represent the visited page itself. This object should soon be deduplicated when
the same page is visited multiple times. After creating a new page object,
the next module is triggered to start analysing the page.

#### [`src/page-analysis`](src/page-analysis/): page analysis

This extracts and stores information about the page in a given tab, such as:
- The plain text of the page, mainly for the full-text
search index.
- Metadata, such as its author, publication date, etcetera.
- A screenshot for visual recognition.

#### [`src/overview/`](src/overview/): overview

The `overview` is the user interface that opens in a tab of its own. It is built
with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/),
which create a somewhat complex but nicely organised application structure.

See [`src/overview/Readme.md`](src/overview/Readme.md) for more details.

#### [`src/search`](src/search/): document search

Functions for finding relevant knowledge in the user's memory. Currently
provides a simple full-text keyword search through visited pages using
[pouchdb-quick-search](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-quick-search).
This can be improved in many ways, because we are searching through a person's
memory, not just some arbitrary document collection. For example, we can use
created assocations and browsing paths to better understand what one is looking
for.

#### [`src/dev/`](src/dev/): development tools

Tools to help during development. They are not used in production builds.

#### [`src/util/`](src/util): utilities

Contains small generic things, stuff that is not project-specific. Things that
could perhaps be packaged and published as an NPM module some day.

#### `...`: other stuff

The build process is a `Makefile`, that runs some `npm` commands specified in
`package.json`, which in turn start the corresponding tasks in
`gulpfile.babel.js` (transpiled by settings in `.babelrc`). All lurking there
so you only have to type `make` to get things running.

So much for the code tour. :zzz:  Any questions? :point_up:
