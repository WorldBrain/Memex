# Memex Features
A browser extension to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents.
Its name and functionalities are heavily inspired by [Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex](http://memex.link/S1zVMgKzX/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

## Full-Text Search in Web History & Bookmarks:

## No VC money, no Exit: Your data & attention stays yours
Memex is funded without VC money or selling shares. Instead we are funded with a model called "Steward Ownership". This model ensures that the company can never be sold and our investors are rewarded with a capped profit share. This way we will never get the incentives to optimise our company for maximising growth & shareholder profits to the expense of your privacy, provider freedom or attention. 
More about our choice you find [in this post](https://community.worldbrain.io/t/why-worldbrain-io-does-not-take-venture-capital/75). 

## Other:

⌨ Keyboard Shortcuts for everything

🗂Tab manager: add all open tabs to a collection or tag
