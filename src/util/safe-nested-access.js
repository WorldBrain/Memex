 *
 * @param {string} path Standard object string path, denoting path of nested keys in an object delimted by period ('.')
 *  eg: with input: { a: { b: { c: 3 } } }, you could pass 'a.b.c' to safely grab 3 without worrying about TypeErrors
 *  being thrown in the case that a or b is undefined.
 * @param {any} object The object to attempt to get the value expressed via pathArr.
 * @return {any|null} Either the value found at pathArr on object, or null if it cannot be found.
