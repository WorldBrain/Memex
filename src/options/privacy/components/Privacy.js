            <h3>Anonymous Usage Statistics</h3>
            WorldBrain.io may collect crash reports and anonymous statistics
            about how users use our website, the Memex software and its
            features.<br />
            This data will <strong>not contain any personal data</strong> (e.g.
            terms you search, the urls you visit/bookmark or the pages you
            blacklist)<br />
            The data is solely used to improve Memex stability, usability and
            features, and is not shared with any 3rd party. <br />
